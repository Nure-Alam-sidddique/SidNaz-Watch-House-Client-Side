          Not all watches are created equal. In fact, some are in a league of
          their own. Combining impressive craftsmanship with a stylish
          aesthetic, luxury watches are so much more than simple accessories;
          they’re wearable works of art. As such, it’s no wonder why names like
          Rolex stir a certain feeling in not only watch enthusiasts but just
          about everyone. So, if you’re looking for a timepiece that’ll provide
          fashion and function for years to come, you can’t go past the world’s
          most lavish watch labels. Unbeatable for their sophisticated designs
          and precise manufacturing, these names ooze prestige and magnificence.
          Here, we’ve rounded up the best luxury watch brands you need to know.

        <Typography variant="h3">Vacheron Constantin</Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          One of the oldest manufacturers of luxury watches, Vacheron
          Constantin, was founded by Jean-Marc Vacheron in 1755, in Geneva
          Switzerland. This brand of fine watches is a member of the Richemont
          Group. Vacheron Constantin’s watches truly reflect their heritage.
          With precise detailing alongside traditional shapes and styling, these
          watches are unlike others. Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have worn
          their watches, along with other noted historical figures like Harry
          Truman and Pope Pius IX.

        <Typography variant="h3">Blancpain</Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          A subsidiary of the Swatch Group, watch brand Blancpain was much like
          the other brands founded in another era; 1735. Blancpain underwent big
          developments, with its growth thriving in the 19th century, updating
          and modernizing production and innovation of their watches. Blancpain
          has a broad range of different watches available; including
          minimalistic designs as well as more elaborately styled pieces.
